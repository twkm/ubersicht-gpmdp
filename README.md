# Google Play Music (and YouTube Music) Desktop Player Ãœbersicht Widget

Show information about the currently-playing song in [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/). Widget tucks nicely next to the dock in the bottom-right of your display (if your dock is not in the bottom of your screen, it displays in the bottom right quarter of the screen).

GPMDP works with Google Play or YouTube Music on the desktop, and provides JSON and Websocket interfaces to display track information through this widget.

## Setup

In GPMDP, make sure you enable the JSON API and Playback API in the preferences so the widget can read track information.

## Thanks
