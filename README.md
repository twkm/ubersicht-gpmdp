# Google Play Music (and YouTube Music) Desktop Player Ãœbersicht Widget

Show information about the currently-playing song in [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/). The widget tucks nicely next to the dock in the bottom-right of your display and resizes as needed. 

GPMDP works with Google Play or YouTube Music on the desktop, and provides JSON and Websocket interfaces to display track information through this widget.

## Setup

In Google Play Music Desktop Player, make sure you enable the JSON API in the preferences so the widget can read track information.

## Notes

**Dock Not Set to Display at Bottom of Screen?**

If your dock is not set to display in the bottom of your screen, it displays in the bottom right third of the screen.

**Missing Track Name and Artist**

There is an [issue in v4.7.1 of GPMDP](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/issues/3888) where the track name and artist are not being set. If an official release is not ready, you can [build GPMDP from source](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-#development) or wait for a v4.7.2+ download.
